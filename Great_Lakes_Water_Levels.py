To use this notebook for your in-class assignment, you will need these 
files, which you shoujld have downloaded:
* mhu.csv -- Lake Michigan and Lake Huron
* sup.csv -- Lake Superior
* eri.csv -- Lake Erie
* ont.csv -- Lake Ontario

As instructed in the in-class activity notebook for today, you are 
only expected to complete one PART below. Do not worry if your group 
is not big enough to finish all parts below, but if you have extra 
time, you're welcome to do so.
